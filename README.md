# Aincrad
 Combat Simulator for an "Open World" Fantasy Class System
 
 The word "Aincrad" is a memento to one of my favorite shows, Sword Art Online. This game tries to replicate the class based system for players in that show. I have also implemented two versions of combat for balance testing.
 
 ## Classes
 
 There are several classes in this game including "Figher", "Tank", "Archer", "Mage" and "Medic". Each class has its own advantages. These are usually reflected in the growth rate of their stats. For example, a player who opts to become a tank will recieve more health each time they upgrade their class. 
 
 ## Stats
 These are a player's main characteristics. They determine the basic abilities of the player such as "health", "mana", "strength", "intelligence" and "speed".
 
 ## Traits
 
 There are several personal traits a character can acquire by luck. Each has its own unique effect. For example, "steel skin" improves defense and gives resistance to certain elements. These effects are not implemented yet.
 
 ## Personal Attributes
 
 Each player is randomly assigned a personal attribute. This gives them a distinct advantage in one area. For example, the attribute "trailblazer" allows a player to begin combat with a temporary boost to all stats.
 
 ## Elements
 
 A player is randomly assigned elemental proficiencies. These mark what elements a player can handle effectively if any. For example, the "light" element would allow a player to deal extra damage when using light based attacks.
 
 ## Armor
 
 Armor can be acquired for separate parts of the body. This usually leads to an increase in defense for that body part. Some armor pieces have special effects as well. These have not been implemented yet.
 
 ## Combat
 
 ###### Version 1
 Both players can attack each other once per round. Attacks are chosen from the list of attacks available to each class. Attacks can be directed to any body part. Each body part requires a different accuracy to hit. Personal attribute effects go into effect based on current time, health etc. Combat can be set to automatic or user-input based.
 
 ###### Version 2
 All the aspects of version one are included. Additionally, both players can attack / block / dodge each other once per round.
